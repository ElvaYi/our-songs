    <h1> All I Want </h1>
    <h2> Emma Bale </h2>
    <p>
      All I want is nothing more <br />
      To hear you knocking at my door<br />
      Cause if I could see your face once more<br />
I     could die a happy man I'm sure<br />
    </p>
    <p>
     When you said your last goodbye<br />
     I died a little bit inside<br />
     I lay in tears in bed all night<br />
     Alone without you by my side<br />
   </p>
   <p>
    But if you loved me<br />
    Why'd you leave me?<br />
    Take my body<br />
    Take my body<br />
    All I want is,<br />
    And all I need is<br />
    To find somebody.<br />
    I'll find somebody like you<br />
    Oh oh<br />
    like you<br />
    Oh oh<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    So you brought out the best of me,<br />
    A part of me I've never seen.<br />
    You took my soul and wiped it clean.<br />
    Our love was made for movie scenes<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But if you loved me<br />
    Why'd you leave me?<br />
    Take my body,<br />
    Take my body.<br />
    All I want is,<br />
    And all I need is<br />
    To find somebody.<br />
    I'll find somebody<br />
    like you<br />
    Oh oh<br />
    like you<br />
    Oh oh<br />
    like you<br />
  </p>
